# Urban Rental Price Prediction

This project is part of an urban analysis assignment where my team and I analyzed U.S. Census Bureau and Zillow housing data to model and predict future rental prices in U.S. cities. We focused on building a robust regression model using feature selection techniques to support data-driven urban planning and policy decisions.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project was to:

- Integrate socio-economic data from the **U.S. Census Bureau** with **Zillow rental data**
- Build predictive models to estimate future rent prices
- Use statistical methods to select the most relevant variables for accurate forecasting

## Key Methods and Tools

- **Data Sources**: 
  - U.S. Census Bureau (socioeconomic indicators)
  - Zillow (city-level rental prices)

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
  - Standardized variable names, handled missing values, and filtered relevant geographic regions.

- **Linear Regression**:
  - Built a multiple linear regression model to understand the influence of different predictors (e.g., population growth, income, housing supply) on rent prices.

- **Backward Selection**:
  - Applied backward elimination (based on AIC criteria) to select the most predictive variables and avoid overfitting.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Assessed model performance using R-squared and RMSE.
  - Visualized actual vs. predicted rental values to evaluate model fit.
    
## Outcome

- Developed a refined regression model with a strong predictive capability for rent prices.
- Identified key socio-economic drivers of urban rental markets.
- Created a reproducible and transparent modeling pipeline for urban data analysis.
